This patch version improves the user experience when using Elttob Relight in very large scenes, and improves how Elttob
Relight interacts with Roblox Studio's undo history in certain edge cases.

• Increases the drag raycast limit from 1,000 to 10,000 studs
• Increases the shadow raycast limit from 1,000 to 10,000 studs
• Drag actions execute properly when ChangeHistoryService:TryBeginRecording() fails to return a recording ID
• Calls to ChangeHistoryService are now protected to avoid uncaught errors when subtle interactions with external plugins cause the undo history to become confused.
