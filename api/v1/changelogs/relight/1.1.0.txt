This minor version introduces keyboard shortcuts for power users.

• Press <b>Tab</b> to switch between dragging the Sun and Moon
• Press <b>Ctrl + (number)</b> to switch modes (Direct, Face, Bounce...)
• Press <b>G</b> to toggle gizmos

These are currently hardcoded via UserInputService, as PluginActions do not support default key bindings. However, it's possible that PluginAction support could be explored in the future.

If you have thoughts on this, feedback would be appreciated over on the Elttob Relight DevForum thread. Thank you :)
