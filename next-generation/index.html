					<p>A brighter take on product and scene lighting.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					What happens when you put a lighting artist in charge of building a lighting plugin? You get
					<em>Elttob Relight</em>, a completely new and creative perspective on an overlooked lighting tool,
					to maximise everything from UGC showcases to FPS levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today's popular tools make you look at your light sources in the sky, so you can drag them around.
					This makes no sense when you're trying to light up objects on the ground. You can't see the effects
					of your changes, and serious friction blocks you from visual explorations and chance discoveries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elttob Relight changes that story, slashing your iteration time from minutes to seconds. It
					introduces four bespoke interaction modes, designed to keep your work directly in front of you. Each
					mode focuses in on one uniquely useful interaction, so you can perfect and tune each component of
					your lighting, and build muscle memory for your most common lighting tasks.

				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/relight/face-mode.svg" alt="Face mode icon">
					<h4>Diffused light on-demand with Face mode.</h4>
					<p>
						Face mode is optimised for working with smooth, organic surfaces such as terrain or
						character models. Click on any surface, and light will fall diffusely onto it from directly
						above. Ideal for workhorse lighting that doesn't draw attention, to let the content of your
						scene stand out.

				<section class="icon-breakout">

					<h4>Reveal the details with Bounce mode.</h4>

						Place reflections and specular highlights exactly where you want them. In Bounce mode, drag
						across different surfaces and watch as the glints from the sun and moon follow your cursor.
						Dapple golden sunsets across water waves, set the tip of a sword ablaze in dusklight, and

					<h4>Paint shadows precisely with Line mode.</h4>

					<h4>Get perfectionist with Shadow mode.</h4>
					<p>
						Make pixel perfect tweaks to your lighting with the most intuitive interaction model yet: drag
						and drop your shadows as if they're physical, tactile objects. Shadow mode takes away the 
						pressure of getting it exactly right first time; you're empowered to explore at the broad level,
						with easy, gentle finessing once it's time to polish up.

						Relight includes simple, useful 3D gizmos that you can enable at a moment's notice, so you can
						directly see the key points and directions as you're relighting. Line up sun rays with key
						shapes on your model, align shadows beautifully with the geometry around them, or intuit where
						that specular highlight is coming from.

					<h3>Sensation</h3>
					<p>The new standard for beautiful, adaptive, intuitive interfaces.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<em>Sensation</em> is Elttob Suite's refined design system, reimagining its revered minimalist look
					with physicality, movement, and thoughtful details. It's more than just cosmetics &mdash; Sensation 
					actively makes the Suite easier to use than ever before.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lighting, shadows, bevels and layered colours build a strong, intuitive hierarchy in the interface
					using natural depth cues. Then, interactivity is layered on top, with responsive, beautiful
					effects to swiftly acknowledge every hover, focus, and press.
				</p>

				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/sensation/colour.svg" alt="Colour icon">
					<h4>Roblox's most advanced theming engine.</h4>
					<p>
						Instead of hard-coding theme colours, Sensation uses an advanced colour perception model to
						generate comfortable, pleasing colour pairings. Colours automatically adapt to the content
						around them, maintaining high contrast, linear gradients, and visually uniform hue &mdash; with
						plenty of room for a signature touch of accent colour.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/sensation/cursor.svg" alt="Cursor icon">
					<h4>Click with confidence.</h4>
					<p>
						Thanks to Sensation's novel pointer prediction engine, there's incredibly low latency as you move
						the mouse &mdash; elements magically respond to your hover before you even arrive.  Plus, with
						Sensation's gorgeous new hover lighting, your focus smoothly flows from element to element,
						guided by soft and subtle movements and fades.

					<img src="icons/sensation/vanilla.svg" alt="Vanilla icon">
					<h4>The icon designs you already love...</h4>
					<p>
						Sensation adopts the beautiful <em>Vanilla</em> icon pack &mdash; a community favourite. Every 
						icon is professionally designed to render sharply at small sizes, based on large silhouettes
						and distinct shape forms. No need to squint; each one is a unique landmark that's easy to
						identify at a passing glance.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/sensation/animation.svg" alt="Animation icon">
					<h4>...brought to life in motion.</h4>

						Why settle for static? Sensation reimagines Vanilla with marvellous micro-interactions; every
						Vanilla icon sports all-new motion and choreography, bringing a touch of joy to even the most
						menial tasks. Animations are rendered with crisp, pixel-perfect detail at your display's native
						frame rate.

				</hgroup>
				<p>
					A next-generation design system calls for next-generation technology to power it. That's why
					Sensation is powered by <em>Fusion</em>, joining a growing community of innovators rewriting the
					book on what UI development can look like.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fusion manages the complex computations behind Sensation's fluid, fast interfaces. Granular reactive
					algorithms optimise the way code links together in a way no other framework can. Random access
					performance is unparalleled, while robust and reliable code design eliminates entire kinds of crashes
					and visual bugs. All in a modular modern architecture, for fast, smooth plugin development that just
					can't be matched.

					<h3>Interposer</h3>
					<p>Your plugins work better together.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					Imagine an ecosystem without borders, where plugins aren't just silos of functionality, but a web
					of combined capabilities. That's <em>Interposer</em>, the secure tech that lets every
					next-generation Elttob Suite plugin co-operate intelligently.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not just a unified home for every product in your Plugins tab, consistently sorted every time
					you launch Studio. It's the big-picture things too &mdash; new possibilities in resilient, 
					distributed backups & recovery, deep UI integrations exposing your plugins
					exactly where they're useful, synchronised preferences, unified update handling, and so much more.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of this communication is secure by design. Interposer is specially crafted to operate across a 
					secure, network-safe boundary, so other plugins never see internal code and never get access to
					plugin-specific abilities. You can rest easy knowing that malicious actors will never get access
					to permissions you didn't give them, or read data you didn't send to them.

					Thanks to significant investment in tech infrastructure, the next-generation Elttob Suite now ships
					with a bevy of modular packages independently developed by Studio Elttob. Every package is built for
					simplicity and speed, with thoughtful, thorough design consideration and real-world performance
					testing. It's next-generation tech for a next-generation Suite.
				</p>
				<p>
					Your own products deserve the latest and greatest technology, too. Many of Studio Elttob's in-house
					packages now use the free & open source MIT license, so you can wield the powerful craftsmanship 
					that's being built into the Elttob Suite today.

				<p>
					Thanks to the ceaseless and thankless activism of so many people in the Roblox community, we have
					together been able to vastly improve the real lived experience of our valued creators. Roblox have
					shown that they care about the creator community and have given us a wonderful Creator Store - now,
					it's time to make it work for as many people as possible.
				</p>
				<p>
					As part of the campaign for fair access around the world, Studio Elttob is pushing for a series of
					actionable key changes and upgrades to the Creator Store and wider economy. The goal? To foster a 
					positive and inclusive environment which breaks down as many historical barriers to success as
					possible.

					<h4>Regional pricing as standard.</h4>
					<p>
						Your birthplace shouldn't be a limiting factor in your creativity &mdash; all Creator Store
