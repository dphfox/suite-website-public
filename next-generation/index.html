					<p>Revered classic. Radical conversion.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					The classic Reclass launched as Roblox's first recommendation-driven reclasser. To save space and
					integrate into your flow, it offered a fresh, focused and lovingly crafted experience, with
					predictive contextual recommendations at its core.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, the all-new Elttob&nbsp;Reclass refines those ideas with care and craftsmanship, built on years 
					of experience, review, and community feedback. Elttob&nbsp;Reclass boasts an ultra-compact design
					that places prominence on Studio&nbsp;Elttob's most intelligent recommendation algorithms to date
					&mdash; all powered by the Elttob&nbsp;Suite's next-generation plugin framework for smoothness and
					fluidity that can't be beat.

					<p>A brighter take on product and scene lighting.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					What happens when you put a lighting artist in charge of building a lighting plugin? You get
					<em>Elttob Relight</em>, a completely new and creative perspective on an overlooked lighting tool,
					to maximise everything from UGC showcases to FPS levels.
				</p>
				<p>
					Today's popular tools make you look at your light sources in the sky, so you can drag them around.
					This makes no sense when you're trying to light up objects on the ground. You can't see the effects
					of your changes, and serious friction blocks you from visual explorations and chance discoveries.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elttob Relight changes that story, slashing your iteration time from minutes to seconds. It
					introduces four bespoke interaction modes, designed to keep your work directly in front of you. Each
					mode focuses in on one uniquely useful interaction, so you can perfect and tune each component of
					your lighting, and build muscle memory for your most common lighting tasks.

				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/relight/face-mode.svg" alt="Face mode icon">
					<h4>Diffused light on-demand with Face mode.</h4>
					<p>
						Face mode is optimised for working with smooth, organic surfaces such as terrain or
						character models. Click on any surface, and light will fall diffusely onto it from directly
						above. Ideal for workhorse lighting that doesn't draw attention, to let the content of your
						scene stand out.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/relight/bounce-mode.svg" alt="Bounce mode icon">
					<h4>Reveal the details with Bounce mode.</h4>
					<p>
						Place reflections and specular highlights exactly where you want them. In Bounce mode, drag
						across different surfaces and watch as the glints from the sun and moon follow your cursor.
						Dapple golden sunsets across water waves, set the tip of a sword ablaze in dusklight, and
						bring PBR materials alive.

				</section>
				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/relight/line-mode.svg" alt="Line mode icon">
					<h4>Paint shadows precisely with Line mode.</h4>
					<p>
						Nail your composition with Line mode &mdash; just drag a line for shadows to follow. Paint bare
						walls with lighting from adjacent structures, drag out long winter shadows for impactful
						scenes, or extend leading lines with clean geometric shadows for that photo-perfect alignment.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section class="icon-breakout">
					<img src="icons/relight/shadow-mode.svg" alt="Shadow mode icon">
					<h4>Get perfectionist with Shadow mode.</h4>
					<p>
						Make pixel perfect tweaks to your lighting with the most intuitive interaction model yet: drag
						and drop your shadows as if they're physical, tactile objects. Shadow mode takes away the 
						pressure of getting it exactly right first time; you're empowered to explore at the broad level,
						with easy, gentle finessing once it's time to polish up.

						Whether you require accurate angles or just need a helping hand getting your bearings. Elttob
						Relight includes simple, useful 3D gizmos that you can enable at a moment's notice, so you can
						directly see the key points and directions as you're relighting. Line up sun rays with key
						shapes on your model, align shadows beautifully with the geometry around them, or intuit where
						that specular highlight is coming from.

					<h3>Sensation</h3>
					<p>The new standard for beautiful, adaptive, intuitive interfaces.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					<em>Sensation</em> is Elttob Suite's refined design system, reimagining its revered minimalist look
					with physicality, movement, and thoughtful details. It's more than just cosmetics &mdash; Sensation 
					actively makes the Suite easier to use than ever before.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lighting, shadows, bevels and layered colours build a strong, intuitive hierarchy in the interface
					using natural depth cues. Then, interactivity is layered on top, with responsive, beautiful
					effects to swiftly acknowledge every hover, focus, and press.

					<img src="icons/sensation/colour.svg" alt="Colour icon">
					<h4>Roblox's most advanced theming engine.</h4>
					<p>
						Instead of hard-coding theme colours, Sensation uses an advanced colour perception model to
						generate comfortable, pleasing colour pairings. Colours automatically adapt to the content
						around them, maintaining high contrast, linear gradients, and visually uniform hue &mdash; with
						plenty of room for a signature touch of accent colour.

						Thanks to Sensation's novel pointer prediction engine, there's incredibly low latency as you move
						the mouse &mdash; elements magically respond to your hover before you even arrive.  Plus, with
						Sensation's gorgeous new hover lighting, your focus smoothly flows from element to element,
						guided by soft and subtle movements and fades.

					<h4>The icon designs you already love...</h4>
					<p>
						Sensation adopts the beautiful <em>Vanilla</em> icon pack &mdash; a community favourite. Every 
						icon is professionally designed to render sharply at small sizes, based on large silhouettes
						and distinct shape forms. No need to squint; each one is a unique landmark that's easy to
						identify at a passing glance.

					<img src="icons/sensation/animation.svg" alt="Animation icon">

						Why settle for static? Sensation reimagines Vanilla with marvellous micro-interactions; every
						Vanilla icon sports all-new motion and choreography, bringing a touch of joy to even the most
						menial tasks. Animations are rendered with crisp, pixel-perfect detail at your display's native
						frame rate.

					<h3>Fusion</h3>

				<p>
					A next-generation design system calls for next-generation technology to power it. That's why
					Sensation is powered by <em>Fusion</em>, joining a growing community of innovators rewriting the
					book on what UI development can look like.
				</p>
				<p>
					Fusion manages the complex computations behind Sensation's fluid, fast interfaces. Granular reactive
					algorithms optimise the way code links together in a way no other framework can. Random access
					performance is unparalleled, while robust and reliable code design eliminates entire kinds of crashes
					and visual bugs. All in a modular modern architecture, for fast, smooth plugin development that just
					can't be matched.

					<h3>Interposer</h3>
					<p>Your plugins work better together.</p>
				</hgroup>
				<p>
					Imagine an ecosystem without borders, where plugins aren't just silos of functionality, but a web
					of combined capabilities. That's <em>Interposer</em>, the secure tech that lets every
					next-generation Elttob Suite plugin co-operate intelligently.
				</p>
				<p>
					It's not just a unified home for every product in your Plugins tab, consistently sorted every time
					you launch Studio. It's the big-picture things too &mdash; new possibilities in resilient, 
					distributed backups & recovery, deep UI integrations exposing your plugins
					exactly where they're useful, synchronised preferences, unified update handling, and so much more.
				</p>
				<p>
					All of this communication is secure by design. Interposer is specially crafted to operate across a 
					secure, network-safe boundary, so other plugins never see internal code and never get access to
					plugin-specific abilities. You can rest easy knowing that malicious actors will never get access
					to permissions you didn't give them, or read data you didn't send to them.

				</p>
				<p>
					Your own products deserve the latest and greatest technology, too. Many of Studio Elttob's in-house
